GraphQL analyser for blocking & throttling.

## Usage

This gem adds a method to limit access to your GraphQL fields by IP:

```rb
QueryType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
  name 'Query'

  field :someExpensiveField do
    rate_limit threshold: 15, interval: 60

    # …
  end
end
```

This would allow only 15 calls per minute by the same IP.

## Requirements

Requires [GraphQL Ruby](http://graphql-ruby.org/) and a running instance
of [Redis](https://redis.io/).

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# GraphQL analyser for blocking & throttling by IP.
gem 'graph_attack'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Add the query analyser to your schema:

```rb
ApplicationSchema = GraphQL::Schema.define do
  query_analyzer GraphAttack::RateLimiter.new

  # …
end
```

Finally, make sure you add the current user's IP address as `ip:` to the
GraphQL context:

```rb
class GraphqlController < ApplicationController
  def create
    result = ApplicationSchema.execute(
      params[:query],
      variables: params[:variables],
      context: {
        ip: request.ip,
      },
    )
    render json: result
  end
end
```

## Configuration

Use a custom Redis client instead of the default:

```rb
query_analyzer GraphAttack::RateLimiter.new(
  redis_client: Redis.new(url: "…")
)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake` to run the tests and the linter. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

## Versionning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available,
see the tags on this repository.

## Releasing

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
